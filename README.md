## [Best Appliances Service Improvement Project](./Best%20Appliances.pdf)

### Overview

The Best Appliances Service Improvement Project aims to enhance the reliability and efficiency of Best Appliances' customer support system. The current system faces challenges such as lost tickets, incorrect specialist assignments, and availability issues. To address these issues, we are implementing a new architecture focused on modularity, scalability, and fault tolerance.

### Key Features

-   **Microservices Architecture:** The project uses a microservices architecture to ensure loose coupling between components, allowing for independent development and easier maintenance.
-   **Improved Ticketing System:** A new ticketing system with sub-domains for ticket creation, assignment, routing, and completion to streamline the ticketing process.
-   **Database Consistency:** Using the BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent) model for database consistency to prioritize system availability and fault tolerance over immediate consistency.
-   **Enhanced Security:** Separate security measures for customer profile and payment information to keep credit card information encrypted, ensuring data security.

### Deployment Strategy

The deployment strategy involves a rolling deployment approach, allowing for the incremental introduction of new features and updates while minimizing disruption and risk. The new microservices will be implemented one at a time, ensuring a smooth transition and maintaining 24/7 accessibility to the service.

### Conclusion

The Best Appliances Service Improvement Project represents a significant step towards improving the reliability, scalability, and efficiency of Best Appliances' customer support system. By implementing a microservices architecture and focusing on modularity and fault tolerance, we aim to deliver a more robust and customer-friendly service.
